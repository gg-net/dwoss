 * Miscellaneous Ui Components.
 * Put hear a UI that don't fit somewhere else.
 * Don't use a sub package.
 * If someone detects, that the misc or the misc.ui package becomes polluted, that means more than 7-10 Classes in the package, create a high priority issue with
 * a Title that indicates that the package need a cleanup.
 * That issue will be solved in a short talk where we all together choose, what will be sorted into packages and what will become a new project.
 * These decisions will be put into extra issues and handle accordingly.
